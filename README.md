# ðŸŽ¨ Design System 2.0

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App (CRA). It builds on Material UI (MUI) to provide a maintained and bullet proven set of UI components. It follows the MUI standards in terms of folder structure, component names and props. For accessability and documentation it extends upon the official MUI documentation by adding an interactive and multi-themeable instance of storybook.
